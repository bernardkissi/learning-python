# ATM Machine Sitmulation

### This challenge tests the understanding of basic introductory concepts to python

    1. classes
    2. modules
    3. SOLID principles:

To build an atm machine which belongs to a specific bank and customers associated that bank
can only use the atm machine.

### constraints

ATM should do the following:

1. show users details
2. show balance left in users wallet
3. user can withdraw from either a saving account or current account
4. user can create an account with a bank
5. customers can opt to print transcation in a text.file

### security concerns

1. user who fails on a third attempt entering their ATM pin should have their account blocked
2. customers account should be checked with the bank before allowing withdrawal
